# 2 Egg Problem

Team 7 - Scripting: nodejs implementation

C5 Code challenge #1: code-bowl.io

## Prerequisites

Node v10

## Running

```bash
npm install
./bin/two-egg 10 5
```

## Source Code

The source code for consideration is found in `main.js` file.

## Dev

You've got everything you need right in this folder. Make changes to `main.js` and test it using `./bin/two-egg`. If you wanna be _super fancy_ run `npm link`, and then you can run just plain old `two-egg` all nice and clean.
